    <h1>Postmodern</h1>

    <p>Postmodern is a Common Lisp library for interacting with <a
    href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> databases.
    Features are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Efficient communication with the database server without
      need for foreign libraries.</li>
      <li>Support for UTF-8 on Unicode-aware Lisp implementations</li>
      <li>A lispy syntax for expressing SQL queries</li>
      <li>Convenient support for prepared statements and stored
      procedures</li>
      <li>Defclass-like definition of tables and associated accessor
      classes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The biggest differences between this library and <a
    href="http://clsql.b9.com/">CLSQL</a>/CommonSQL are that
    postmodern has no intention of being portable across different SQL
    implementations (it embraces non-standard Postgres features), and
    approaches extensions like lispy SQL and database access objects
    in a quite different way. This library was written because the
    CLSQL approach did not really work for me, your mileage may
    vary.</p>

    a few more bugs have been fixed.</p>

    <p class="news"><em>13-06-2007:</em> <a

    <p class="news"><em>15-05-2007:</em> <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/postmodern/postmodern-1.00.tgz">Version
    1.00</a>: A few minor bugfixes and tweaks, most notably a fix that
    makes Postmodern work on LispWorks. Since the stream of bug
    reports seems to have more or less dried up, I bumped the version
    number up to 1, and this release should not be considered a beta
    version anymore.</p>

    <p class="news"><em>16-03-2007:</em> <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/postmodern/postmodern-0.24.tgz">Version
    .24</a>: Fixes <a
    href="cl-postgres.html#database-connection-lost"><code>:reconnect</code></a>
    restarts, add varargs to <a
    href="postmodern.html#query"><code>query</code></a> and <a

    bug that caused connections to go out of sync when the server sent
    warnings.</p>

    <p class="news"><em>29-01-2007:</em> <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/postmodern/postmodern-0.23.tgz">Version

    <p class="news"><em>27-01-2007:</em> <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/postmodern/postmodern-0.22.tgz">Version
    .22</a>. Another change to <a
    href="s-sql.html#create-table"><code>:create-table</code></a>,
    this time to add support for constraints and a few other things
    that the plain-SQL version lets you specify. The approach to
    transactions (see <a
    href="postmodern.html#with-transaction"><code>with-transaction</code></a>)
    was also changed. The old approach was actually incorrect, now it
    should be more robust.</p>

    <p class="news"><em>23-01-2007:</em> <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/postmodern/postmodern-0.21.tgz">Version
    .21</a> released, which mostly corrects minor mistakes. The syntax
    of <a
    href="s-sql.html#create-table"><code>:create-table</code></a> was
    changed: it no longer takes a <code>nil</code>/<code>t</code>
    value to indicate whether a column can be null, but uses the same
    <code>(or db-null type)</code> notation as <a
    href="postmodern.html#deftable"><code>deftable</code></a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="dependencies"></a>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>The library depends on <a
    href="http://cliki.net/usocket">usocket</a>, <a
    href="http://www.cliki.net/CL-MD5">md5</a>, <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/ieee-floats">ieee-floats</a>,
    <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/trivial-utf-8">trivial-utf-8</a>
    if you want Unicode support, and <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads">bordeaux-threads</a>
    if you want thread-safe connection pools.</p>

    <p>Postmodern itself is split into 4 different parts, some of
    which can be used independantly. <a
    href="simple-date.html">Simple-date</a> is a very basic
    implementation of date and time objects, used to support storing
    and retrieving time-related SQL types. <a
    href="cl-postgres.html">Cl-postgres</a> is the low-level library
    used for interfacing with a PostgreSQL server over a socket. <a
    href="s-sql.html">S-SQL</a> is used to compile s-expressions to
    strings of SQL code, doing as much as possible of the work at
    compile time. Finally, <a href="postmodern.html">postmodern</a>
    itself is the library that tries to put all these things together
    into a convenient programming interface.</p>

    <h2><a name="license"></a>License</h2>

    <p>Postmodern is released under a BSD-like license. Which
    approximately means you can use the code in whatever way you like,
    except for passing it off as your own or releasing a modified
    version without indication that it is not the original.</p>

    href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke<a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="quickstart"></a>Quickstart</h2>

    <p>This quickstart is intended to give you a feel of the way
    coding with postmodern works. Further details about the workings
    of the library can be found in the <a href="#reference">reference
    manual</a>.</p>

    <p>Assuming you have already installed it, first load &amp; use
    the system:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :postmodern)
(use-package :postmodern)</pre>

    <p>If you have a PostgreSQL server running on localhost, with a
    database called 'testdb' on it, which is accessible for user
    'foucault' with password 'surveiller', you can connect like
    this:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(connect-toplevel "testdb" "foucault" "surveiller" "localhost")</pre>

    <p>Which will establish a connection to be used by all code,
    except for that wrapped in a <a
    href="postmodern.html#with-connection"><code>with-connection</code></a>
    form, which takes the same arguments but only establishes the
    connection locally.</p>

    <p>Now for a basic sanity test:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(query "select 22, 'Folie et déraison', 4.5")
;; => ((22 "Folie et déraison" 9/2))</pre>

    <p>That should work. But, this being Lisp, we really hate to use
    languages with so little parentheses in our programs:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(query (:select 22 "Folie et déraison" 4.5))
;; => ((22 "Folie et déraison" 9/2))</pre>

    <p>In truth, parentheses aren't the decisive reason for this
    alternate syntax. The nice thing is that you can feed lisp values
    directly into your query like this, without converting them to
    strings yourself. Queries like the one above, with only constants
    in them, get converted to strings entirely at compile time. When
    you add for example a variable or an expression, only the static
    part of the query gets built at compile time, and the dynamic
    parts are inserted at run time. Like this:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(defun database-powered-addition (a b)
  (query (:select (:+ a b)) :single))
(database-powered-addition 1030 204)
;; => 1234</pre>

    <p>That last argument, <code>:single</code>, indicates that we
    want the result not as a list of lists (for the result rows), but
    as a single value, since we know we are only selecting one value.
    Some other options are <code>:rows</code>, <code>:row</code>,
    <code>:column</code>, <code>:alists</code>, and
    <code>:none</code>. Their precise effect is documented in the <a
    href="postmodern.html#query">reference manual</a>.</p>

    <p>You do not have to pull in the whole result of a query at once,
    you can also iterate over it with the <a
    href="postmodern.html#doquery"><code>doquery</code></a> macro:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(doquery (:select 'x 'y :from 'some-imaginary-table) (x y)
  (format t "On this row, x = ~A and y = ~A.~%" x y))</pre>

    <p>Now let us define a table.</p>

    <pre class="code">
(deftable test-data ()
  ((field1 :type integer)
   (field2 :type (or string db-null))
   (field3 :type (numeric 10 3)))
   (:indices field1 field3))

(create-table 'test-data)</pre>

    <p>This will add a table named test_data (on the SQL side, from
    Lisp you can approach it as <code>test-data</code>), with one
    integer (32-bit signed) column, one column of type text, which may
    be null, and one of type numeric(10, 3). The table will have
    indices on field1 and field3, with the one on field1 being the
    primary index because it comes first in the index list.</p>

    <p>You might notice that this <a
    href="postmodern.html#deftable"><code>deftable</code></a> form
    looks quite a lot like a <code>defclass</code>. You can use it
    like that too:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(deftable test-data ()
  ((field1 :type integer :initarg :field1 :accessor field1)
   (field2 :type (or string db-null) :initform :null :accessor field2)
   (field3 :type (numeric 10 3) :initarg :field3 :accessor field3))
  (:indices field1 field3)
  (:class-name test-data))</pre>

    <p>Adding a <code>:class-name</code> option will result in the
    definition of an accessor class (dao is the term postmodern uses,
    which means either 'Database Access Object' or 'The Way'). This
    class has a slot for every column in the table, and has methods
    for storing or retrieving instances to and from the database.</p>

    <pre class="code">
(make-instance 'test-data :field1 44 :field3 99.9)
;; => #&lt;TEST-DATA {ABD4E89}&gt;
(save-dao *)
(field3 (get-dao 'test-data 44))
;; => 999/10</pre>

    <p><a href="postmodern.html#save-dao"><code>save-dao</code></a>
    will save a dao, calling <a
    href="postmodern.html#insert-dao"><code>insert-dao</code></a> if
    no rows with the same primary key exist, or <a
    href="postmodern.html#update-dao"><code>update-dao</code></a> if
    there is such a row. <a
    href="postmodern.html#get-dao"><code>get-dao</code></a> takes one
    argument for every column in the primary index of this table, and
    will return a dao if a column with those values exists.</p>

    <p>The reason you get back a ratio (<code>999/10</code>) instead
    of the float you initially fed the object is because field3 is of
    type numeric, which is a fixed-precision type, not floating
    point.</p>

    <p>To demonstrate a bit more of the S-SQL syntax, here is the
    query the utility function <a
    href="postmodern.html#list-tables"><code>list-tables</code></a>
    uses to get a list of the tables in a database:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(sql (:select 'relname :from 'pg-catalog.pg-class
      :inner-join 'pg-catalog.pg-namespace :on (:= 'relnamespace 'pg-namespace.oid)
      :where (:and (:= 'relkind "r")
                   (:not-in 'nspname (:set "pg_catalog" "pg_toast"))
                   (:pg-catalog.pg-table-is-visible 'pg-class.oid))))
;; => "(SELECT relname FROM pg_catalog.pg_class 
;;      INNER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace ON (relnamespace = pg_namespace.oid)
;;      WHERE ((relkind = 'r') and (nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'pg_toast'))
;;             and pg_catalog.pg_table_is_visible(pg_class.oid)))"</pre>

    <p><a href="s-sql.html#sql"><code>sql</code></a> is a macro that
    will simply compile a query, it can be useful for seeing how your
    queries are expanded or if you want to do something unexpected
    with them.</p>

    <p>As you probably guessed, lists starting with keywords are used
    to express SQL commands and operators (lists starting with
    something else will be evaluated and then inserted into the
    query). Quoted symbols name columns or tables (keywords can also
    be used but might introduce ambiguities). The syntax supports
    subqueries, multiple joins, stored procedures, etc. See the S-SQL
    <a href="s-sql.html">reference manual</a> for a complete
    treatment.</p>

    <p>Finally, here is an example of the use of prepared
    statements:</p>

    <pre class="code">
(defprepared select-things
  (:select 'field2 'field3 :from 'test-data :where (:= 'field1 '$1))
  :alists)
(select-things 44)
;; => (((:FIELD2 . :NULL) (:FIELD3 . 999/10)))</pre>

    <p>The <a
    href="postmodern.html#defprepared"><code>defprepared</code></a>
    macro creates a function that takes the same amount of arguments
    as there are <code>$X</code> placeholders in the given query. The
    query will only be parsed and planned once (per database
    connection), which can be faster, especially for complex
    queries.</p>

    <pre class="code">
(disconnect-toplevel)</pre>

    <h2><a name="reference"></a>Reference</h2>

    <p>The reference manuals for the different components of
    postmodern are kept in separate files. For using the library in
    the most straighforward way, you only really need to read the <a
    href="postmodern.html">postmodern reference</a> and glance over
    the <a href="s-sql.html">S-SQL reference</a>. The <a
    href="simple-date.html">simple-date</a> reference explains the
    time-related data types used by postmodern, and the <a
    href="cl-postgres.html">cl-postgres reference</a> might be useful
    if you just want a low-level library for talking to a PostgreSQL
    server.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="postmodern.html">Postmodern</a></li>
      <li><a href="s-sql.html">S-SQL</a></li>
      <li><a href="simple-date.html">Simple-date</a></li>
      <li><a href="cl-postgres.html">Cl-postgres</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="caveats"></a>Caveats and to-do's</h2>

    <h3>Timezones</h3>

    <p><a href="simple-date.html">Simple-date</a> has no concept of
    time zones. This means that using it is rather error-prone, and if
    you really need your time-keeping to be reliable and/or universal
    you should either not use the types it provides or think really
    hard about the way you handle time zones.</p>

    <p>I was going to fix this by combining my code with stuff from <a
    href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/local-time">local-time</a>,
    but ran out of motivation. If you really need a reliable time
    datatype, you could consider finishing this.</p>

    <h3>Portability</h3>

    <p>The Lisp code in Postmodern is theoretically portable across
    implementations, and seems to work on all major ones. I am not
    actively testing against new releases or obscure implementations,
    but if you run into problems you are welcome to contact me through
    the <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/postmodern-devel">mailing
    list</a>, and we can try to solve them.</p>

    <p>The library will definitely not work for PostgreSQL versions
    older than 7.4 (it uses a client/server protocol that was
    introduced then). On versions prior to 8.1, retrieving the <a
    href="simple-date.html">simple-date</a> classes is buggy, because
    their binary representation was changed.</p>

    <h3>Things that should be implemented</h3>

    <p>Support for foreign keys and constraints should be added to <a
    href="postmodern.html#deftable"><code>deftable</code></a>. This
    will make code that automatically creates or alters tables quite a
    bit more complex: it will have to take care not to violate any
    contraints, which can be tricky in PostgreSQL.</p>

    <p>It would be a neat feature if <a
    href="postmodern.html#table-description"><code>table-description</code></a>
    would return a nicer representation of field types (Lisp type
    expressions). Some attempt could be made to add a function that
    compares a table's representation in the database with the
    corresponding table structure as defined by a <a
    href="postmodern.html#deftable"><code>deftable</code></a>, and
    automatically (interactively) writes the queries needed to update
    the table in the database.</p>

    <p>Functions for adding sequences, stored procedures, and views to
    the templates that <a
    href="postmodern.html#deftable"><code>deftable</code></a>-style
    tables are currently stored in would make these a viable way to
    define and store database schemas.</p>

    <p>Several of these issues are adressed by Ryszard Szopa's <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/submarine">Submarine</a>
    library, a more advanced table-declaration and access-object
    library built on top of Postmodern.</p>
